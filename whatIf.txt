What if there was no lie?
Nothin' wrong, nothin' right
What if there was no time
And no reason or rhyme?

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
 make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life?

Ooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Ooh, that's right
step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
