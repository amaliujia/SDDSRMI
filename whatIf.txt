What if there was no lie?
Nothin' wrong, nothin' right
What if there was no time
And no reason or rhyme?

What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side
That you don't want me there in your life?

What if I got it wrong?
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong

What if you should decide
