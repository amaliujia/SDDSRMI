What if there was no lie?\
Nothin' wrong, nothin' right\
What if there was no time\
And no reason or rhyme?\
\
What if you should decide\
That you don't want me there by your side\
That you don't want me there in your life?\
\
What if I got it wrong?\
And no poem or song\
Could put right what I got wrong\
Or make you feel I belong\
\
What if you should decide\
That you don't want me there by your side\
That you don't want me there in your life?\
\
Ooh, that's right\
Let's take a breath, jump over the side\
Ooh, that's right\
How can you know it if you don't even try?\
Ooh, that's right\
\
Every step that you take\
Could be your biggest mistake\
It could bend or it could break\
But that's the risk that you take\
\
What if you should decide\
That you don't want me there in your life\
That you don't want me there by your side?\
\
Ooh, that's right\
Let's take a breath, jump over the side\
Ooh, that's right\
How can you know it when you don't even try?\
Ooh, that's right\
\
Ooh, that's right\
Let's take a breath, jump over the side\
Ooh, that's right\
You know that darkness always turns into light\
Ooh, that's right\
